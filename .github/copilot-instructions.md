## Known Issues & Solutions
- **Multiple Connector View Stability (Fixed v0.0.5)**: Implemented per-connector panel isolation using Map-based panel management to prevent data mixing between multiple open connector views. Each connector now maintains its own webview panel instance with proper cleanup on disposal.
- **OffsetEditor Panel Management (Fixed v0.0.5)**: Applied same Map-based panel management pattern to OffsetEditor for consistency with ConnectorView approach. Ensures isolated panel instances per connector for offset editing operations.
- **Production Debug Logs (Fixed v0.0.5)**: Removed all console.log statements from production code and replaced with proper logging using VS Code output channel system. All debug information now goes through centralized getOutputChannel() with consistent formatting.
- **Security Vulnerability (Acknowledged - Not Fixing)**: Base64 password storage in settings.json is acknowledged security issue. Mitigations are in place (VS Code SecretStorage fallback), decision made not to fix at this time.
- **VS Code Extension Pattern**: For webview panels, always use unique identifiers and proper state isolation when dealing with multiple instances of the same view type.
- **Memory Management**: Always implement proper cleanup in onDidDispose handlers to prevent memory leaks in long-running extension sessions.
- **Panel Management Best Practice**: Use Map-based panel storage with unique identifiers rather than singleton patterns when multiple instances of the same view type need to coexist.
- **Logging Best Practice**: Always use getOutputChannel().appendLine() for debug/info logging instead of console.log in VS Code extensions.
